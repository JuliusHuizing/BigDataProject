1. Data Collection and Integration
Objective: Gather data from various sources and combine it into a cohesive dataset.
Activities: Identifying data sources, data extraction, and data merging.
2. Data Cleaning
Objective: Improve data quality by addressing inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and missing values.
Activities: Handling missing values (imputation, deletion), correcting errors, removing duplicates, and identifying outliers.
3. Data Transformation
Objective: Convert data into a format or structure that is more appropriate for analysis.
Activities:
Normalization/Standardization: Adjusting the scale of data.
Aggregation: Summarizing or combining data.
Discretization: Transforming continuous variables into categorical variables.
4. Data Reduction
Objective: Reduce the volume but produce the same or similar analytical results.
Activities:
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables.
Feature Selection: Choosing the most relevant features for the model.
5. Feature Engineering
Objective: Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Activities: Extracting features, creating interaction terms, binning, and encoding categorical variables.
6. Data Splitting
Objective: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Activities: Random splitting, stratified splitting to maintain the proportion of categories.
7. Data Augmentation (specifically for deep learning)
Objective: Artificially increase the size and variability of the dataset.
Activities: Creating modified copies of data through techniques such as cropping, padding, and flipping (for images), or synonym replacement and back-translation (for text).
Each phase plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data is primed for the subsequent analysis or machine learning model training, addressing different aspects of data quality, relevance, and representativeness. The importance and complexity of each phase can vary significantly depending on the specific requirements of the project, the nature of the data, and the goals of the analysis or predictive modeling being undertaken.
