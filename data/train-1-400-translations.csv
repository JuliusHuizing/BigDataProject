"I found at first it was a little difficult to associate Matt Damon as anything else but Jason Bourne.But as the film settled in I forgot Jason.The story wasn't overely bright but was conclusive as to what it was all about.That is the Americans covering a story which has already been told.i.e The Big Cover Up,of the Iraq affair.Overall I thought it was a good film , forget the politics watch the film.Good graffics,lots of action etc.4 out of 5*'s."
"I like this story. The actors - and especially Maggie Smith - liked me. I'm convinced! I don't like it as much as others, but I liked it."
Is it a coincidence that most Disney princesses and other main characters have been missed from this collection??It remains a nice book but that leaves well on her hunger.
"Wayne Dyer is a popular american personal growth author and Your Erroneous Zones was his break through book. Personally I don't know why he became so popular, I think his style is kind of arrogant and patronizing and misses empathy for his readers. Maybe it's just me projecting on him, but personally I don't like his vibes."

"The film is excellent suspense level... I would compare it a little &agrave; \\""Total Recall\"" (science fiction in less) or \\""6th sense\"" for the originality&eacute; of the style of filming/history.<br />This is the story of a guy who has problems with m&eacute;more, but what is excellent is that the film \\""play\"" with you, and it obliges you &agrave; test &agrave; fund your own m&eacute;more!<br />A see absolutely: the style and man&egrave;re of filming is original."

Chateau easy to climb and conform to the description. My daughter is very happy. Tres satisfied with the product. I recommend it.
"I loved the film Gravity.  It is a technical masterpiece, and as close to the experience of being in space I am ever likely to get.  However I was amazed to see the score nominated for an Oscar.  &#34;What score?&#34; I thought to myself.  I didn't recall any music throughout the film, so it was a trip to Amazon to hunt it out.  Within seconds I was transported back to the claustrophobic yet endless terror of the film by a score that serves the movie ultimately.  The Gravity score is one of the most important elements of the film.  On its own it is a challenging listen, but is a stunning achievement, like the pictures it so ably accompanies."
"First, what attracts attention is the magnet placed on the face of the steelbook, this is holographic so we can see Bruce or Joseph in the main character what I find not bad."
I discovered this author a little by chance and I liked it. I will order the other titles of this author at my next order.
"If you already like Bones this may not be quite as good, some episodes a little slow. But still good to watch."
Facebook Messenger likes me a lot and new good possibilities are there<br />and easy to use by hand.
Great easy watch film
"C too top telecharge it, we quickly increase money so<br />T&Eacute;L&Eacute;CHARGE it!<br /> For those who are not fans of this kind of games will become it, I guarantee it.<br />There are a lot of things to build so<br />T&Eacute;L&Eacute;CHARGE it"
3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS. it was a very good finale to a very good-yet not fantastic-series. Tom and the rest of them flee from Wicked after being forced to have their memories back. Tome and Minho and Newt and Brenda are seperted from Teresa and the others and flee to denver. once they arrive in denver however they face more problems. the whole city has gone mad. nearly everyone is on bliss or past gone. and the wicked and rat man are trying to get him.<br /><br />WARNING MASSIVE SPOILER!!! i wont say more about the actual story but it was a shame when newt died. however i really didnt like it when teresa was killed. she was the only character i liked more then tom and i was very upset when she died. i actually took off half a mark because of that.
"I bought the movie on the basis of the trailer and the reviews here. And I have to say the movie is the hammer. You are constantly under electricity when watching. tension at the highest level, nerve bite from the first minute to.<br /><br />Absolute purchase recommendation, every euro is well invested..."
"Dear Christopher Nolan, what has happened? The Dark Knight Rises is probably the worst Batman of your triology. I don't know where to start. That's why I prefer to leave it. You have to watch the movie unfortunately, since it's the third part of a triology so planned from the beginning (duh!). That's why it doesn't get anything to argue over the film itself.<br /><br />The DVD is good. sound and image quality is good. content is not so full."
I disliked this dictionary because it was boring and it wasn't entertaining to me. I think it should be entertaining.
"A wonderful read - amusing, escapist and unpredictable. I can't think of any reason why you should give this a go."
A really classic album - takes me back to my youth with denim and patchouli - one to still enjoy.
"Cannot wait for the next book :) really interesting characters, although I would recommend re-reading the first book again if you haven't done so for a while..."
"Graphism: well 4/5<br />gameplay: push one finger to jump, the other to put a finger: nice to the debut, fast boring at a measure. 3/5<br /><br />And we get to the black point; I thought by paying the game we would be able to enjoy it entirely."
"Do we have free will? Or is everything preordained? As a rationalist, I thought the former was true, but Sawyer makes a compelling case drawing on modern physics that the latter is really the case. His story is poised  right at the edge of our real world. It takes place at CERN (a real  particle physics lab in Europe) and involves the Large Hadron Collider  (which CERN is really building) and echoes the concerns of a few years ago  when we were worried about a plutonium bearing satellite possibly breaking  up and polluting the Earth about just who has the right to make decisions  that just might affect all of humankind.  The characters---Swiss, Canadian,  American, Japanese, Chinese---are all well drawn. Sawyer perhaps makes too  much of a tangential parallel to the movie THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL  but that's a minor quibble. This is a first rate novel."
"I've always enjoyed this film, spectacular settings on the Riviera with villas on the hills and yachts in the bay, well cast actors, elegant, romantic, stylish, witty, the stuff which dreams are made of... until she says: 'oh mother will love this!'"
"I'm not a 100% cinephile that's going to extase in front of the latest movie ouzbek or Iranian but I don't think I'm either a beauf that's going to extase in front of any ship. In short, I think I've been watching this movie because I've been saying a lot of the different facets of the cinema from the moment it touches my heart or my mind or my trips (it's not a proof of affection or credibility and I don't try to prove anything but it's been more than 40 years I'm going to the cinema regularly or I'm watching the DVDs (I've also seen about 2000 all the styles confused)). I've been watching this movie because I've been saying a lot of it's good (I've not had it's badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly badly."
Nothing to add more to the many elogies on this saga. I hadn’t reviewed it for years and I’m pleasantly surprised that the saga is still as addictive! The B-R is great and the children are as attached as me: a great &#34; classical&#34; family whatever our age.
"fascinating read , and coming from a professional , very believable, Hope it,s true"
The 3rd CD does not present too much interest because they are just remixes but I'm satisfied with the other two.
"Three good isolation of the external environment (without cut completely)<br />Robuste (I use it for 1 year and range it in a lot in my bag)<br />Soon of three good quality: I judge it just below my Koss Porta Pro, more versatile, but the bases are more powerful and as I hear most of the rock it is interesting.<br />But the micro for the phone is of poor quality"

"A must for every plate collection. go right away, just the opener &#34;Enter Sandman&#34; rock like Sau! perfect to drive the car."
"With in prize an expo on the island on the translation of this book in 17 countries, that happiness and joy to find all the unusual places of the island described by the author."
A little too soft that’s not the most representative versions of PHil Collins didn’t completely satisfy me with the fact.
"Hello,<br />As always as flamboyant, misgrees some hesitation in the Scenario The Sign of the Three.<br />Only I wonder if there is no lack of a protection card because the DVDs are just in the section that contains them."
"This is without doubt one of the weirdest things I've ever heard. Ever. It makes the Beatles' Revolution Number 9 sound like a nice, simple pop song in comparison. On this recording, the Captain and co. merge together blues, freeform jazz, avant garde and spoken word to create something the likes of which hadn't been heard before, or probably since either (except on more Beefheart records of course). All very interesting, I hear you say, and on this account comparisons to Zappa or Gong may crop up. Yet Beefheart takes the freeform apprach to a whole new level- most of the stuff here, like Frownland or Dachau Blues sounds like every member of the group was told to record what the hell they want and then it was all pasted together. Random and amateurish? Not a chance. To break the rules, you've gotta know the rules, and to play stuff in such crazy, syncopated timings like this requires a level of skill rarely heard today. Beefheart's freeform poetry for me is the most interesting aspect of the record though, picking out the words and then trying to make sense of lines such as 'Peeled n felts fields n belts impaled on n daeman' on Neon Meate Dream of A Octafish is a joy. Listening to this all the way through in one sitting is a bit like running a half-marathon; it's uneasy and demanding, but you feel strangely better for it afterwards. Naturally, such a bonkers album isn't going to be to everyone's taste (personally, I'd like to see this stuff performed on CD:UK). I'm giving it 3 stars because I think there are better Beefheart albums out there, such as my personal favourite Ice Cream For Crow, and its insane weirdness limits its replayability. Get it anyway to hear something truly unique, and it's definitely worth buying to freak out your friends who like Justin Timberlake when they come round."
lovely book
"When I was in the cinema a year ago, I was attached to the film and pulled into it:D<br /><br />THE MORE ACTION, (Sorry not Megan Foxx but no matter)<br /><br />To content I won't come:D<br /><br />I recommend it to everyone!"
"This fascinating film is a real gift to watch with LIAM NEESON who keeps us breathing to the end. A film has not been missing especially for thriller,suspension or polar fans. I recommend it to everyone. This is a real moment of cinema to breathe."
"I read the book again in pleasure to the film and was then very exchanged on the film. If you like to make three films from a book that has no 400 pages, then you should expect that it should not be a too big problem to keep yourself closely on the presentation. The reason to clearly deviate from the novel show was probably not at the time, but on the marketing. You were probably striving to cling clearly to \\""Lord of the Rings\"" to bring the people. Likewise there were some fragile action scenes that the young CGI spectacle-habited audience should satisfy."
"I am generally very critical and have seen enough movies to compare and have to say: this movie plays quite up with! The beginning is a weak but just the next scene travels the spectator with and after the film there is only an increase until it comes to the final, where my friends and I stop the breath sychron and after a few minutes they go out again together. <br />The film is well gecasted, well played and singed, well choreographed, well cut and has a classic director! <br /> <br />You just have to see it."
"Both Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro are great, acting in their role"
"Unfortunately I am again disappointed with American written books.It must be a culture thing.I am ex-Special Forces (UK) and I could never write a book in such away. My grandfather was a sniper in WW1, he survived the whole 4years and came out in 1919 with the Military Medal. I wish I could say something positive about the book. But I cannot."
"As with the other Game of Thrones books, this one was fantastic from start to finish! Didn't want it to end yet totally addicted to reading so I could find out what happens!! George R R Martin's writing style is superb, I've read a LOT of books and never come across writing as fantastic as his!"
This book arrived super quick and packaged great too. As for price well great value for all 3 of the books and postage was free.
I love vampire movies unfortunately it's not the way I've imagined it.<br />The action is not so good.
"Really really pleased with this. I am a huge Kelly Clarkson fan and this product was exactly what it would be. It was delivered and dispatched really quickly.<br /><br />If you are a Kelly Clarkson fan, this is probably a must get. It contains all her hits, what more can you ask for? Favourite tracks are Dark Side, Because of You, Stronger, Behind These Hazel Eyes and My Life Would Suck Without You."
"I loved this, it's funny and witty and describes situations that every woman can empathise with even if they haven't been in exactly the same situation yourself, the lads aren't excluded in this as C.M manages to write and reveal a very easy and down to earth feminism without being 'ranty' and as such is very accessible.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any and everyone, I laughed out loud (and got funny looks from strangers on the train) and even cryed at some bits, a must read for everyone I think."
"...and well it would go out of the 10 cds that I will take with me. The texts, the music are wonderful!!a athmosphere..as it would say...mmm...filled with poetry..yes, it’s so!"
Another good novel by Philippa Gregory.<br />I have read all of these historical novels and am then impatient for the next one to come out.
Good game lots of different areas to explore helpful hints and puzzles not to difficult look forward for the next game
A book all carton&eacute; in which a CD is included: it’s the author himself who tells the story!<br />The format is relatively large: 27 x 23 cm.<br />I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase!
"Brilliant album I am listening too over and over again. Love his tone, his star quality, pretty much all of his music, a true rising star."
"You can no longer present the cultuous story of this anime drawing, one of Walt Disney's most beautiful masterpieces. of magnificent landscapes, a band full of emotion on a universal subject."
"At first hearing, I thought \\""this is an album for me\\"" (and bought it). After listening to it a couple of times, I find myself in agreement with Michael Ross in the lead review  -  she needs \\""livelier arrangements\\"" and \\""the knack of remaining low-key without being sleepy\\"". Quite a few of the numbers here are sung in a way which is just too slow, quiet and laid back  -  a bit more pzazz could have helped some of them enormously. For someone current who seems to know, intuitively, exactly how to present old standards with just the right tempo and volume, try Stacey Kent."
"After religously watching and re-watching the previous 5 series, many, many discussions with friends/colleagues/complete strangers at parties a couple of years ago (!) we were very, very happy to get Lost series 6.  2 days later we still have a whole heap of questions, almost all beginning 'Why?'  We didn't get the answers we were looking for - Desmond/Hatch/Button, Hurley/Lottery Numbers/Relevance, Penny's Dad??!!  What was he there for?  Jack going back, turning into a drunken, obsessed 'returnee' - I could go on but I'm boring myself.  Really disappointing, same anti-climax as The Sopranos.  Lost series 6 seems to have got lost itself."
"A absolute cult film and my personal number 1! <br />As the Fight Club at the time came to the cinema and a friend brought me into it, I didn't expect much, the title read me fratzengeballer in the type of Van Damme films suspected, but far missed, this film belongs to the deepest and most complex of the film history. You can still watch it so often, you discover again and again new details. We were so enthusiastic about this masterpiece that we immediately went again to the next show, that's before me and later never happens. The best acting performance of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton doesn't need any more words, this film's masterpiece is a class for the film's story. You can still see it so often, you discover new details. We were so enthusiastic about this masterpiece that we immediately went again to the next show, that's before me and later."
This is one of gary barlow's great album's it is easy to listen to over and over again and would not get bored of it.
"I don’t find any very good quality. the hair part that is there (just that makes the thing yes to a rapunzel) is a bad joke. too little, too thin, just nix.<br />naja, the little has the barbie now amputed a leg and throwed her hair and painted...this way the puppe has at least brought a little more fun and was worth the money :-)"
"As a Potterhead, I had to buy the 2 DVD collector version as I have all the other and this movie is waiting in relation to the book!!"
"A film like we see now very little, which leads us to the deepest of ourselves, search in our consciousness and discover our real self. A film to watch at every time with the same pleasure, with actors at the top of their game, and a real scenario &quot;shock of point&quot;..."
Great holiday read and  was never sure what the ending would be. I will be recommending it to my friends.
"Fantastic, thats all I can say"
True great movie. I can only recommend. exciting from the beginning to the end. Playing in a psychiatry and really the hammer.
"A wait and a bit of disappointment due to this wait which does not prevent me from having a lot of love. I recommend it because often watching several times, the opinion is often improved."
Ancient band whose music is often recalled in some current films such as: The Big Lebowski of Coen Brothers and Battleship Indemodable!
"The plastic box is not the quali of the highest quality, paper is good, finally some other patterns.... (but I have not used it as a origami paper, but as a decopaper to cover mirror flies)."
If at the beginning of Mysteria words like &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the Freakshow&quot; then this is a genius and 100%-ig Intro that describes the content of the CD!<BR>Now to sound:<BR>-It is the Babelsberger Orhester at that time but you notice it is not necessary it gives the music only a surprisingly atmospheric effect<BR>-If I mysteria hor reminds me EDGUY (Tobias Sammet) somehow to the air-protection sirene Bruce Dickison!
"I am amazed at the accuracy of this product. I live very close to the Gatwick flight path and often wondered where the planes were from, and going too. All has been answered. The biggest problem with this app is that I cant put it down, it is so addictive!"
"What Zack Snyder offers is simply brachial.<br />The film shots all the other superhero films around long.<br />There can the \\""Avengers\"" pack and go home.<br />Emotions & Action that we don't know and know in this form.<br /><br />Better you can't film Man of Steel...<br /><br />Thank Zack...thank Nolan..."
"Funny, clever and exciting book; very hard to put down. It has been a while since I have enjoyed<br />a book like this one.<br />LOVED IT!"
For me as a Crimijunkie exactly the right thing.I watched the series on TV and then bought it immediately.Here with the next season!!!!!
"A birthday gift... after 10 minutes, the top was cassee, after the toupie was tombee from our table. For this price, I would have thought the quality was better."
"This should be read by every married couple. I would give it as a wedding present. Great read if your single, may help you find the right one for you."
"Great ideas, clear instructions, and enthusiastic about just what might be achieved.  I found the book and the author's clear and detailed instructions of great help."
A great book that I first came across when working as a TA in a primary school. Children really love this book as do I. Also used this in children's literature module at university. It was a great help and I really enjoyed reading it and still do even at the age of 21.
"A little decued by this episode that is not at the height of the precedents. Lack of breath and intensity, lengths... Even if the images are beautiful (plane big natural spaces) it is not what we come to look for in this episode.<br />Jeremy Renner has no charism and the presence of Matt Damon.<br />We hope the next opus will be more attractive, because apparently the decor is planted for a continuation!"
"An album of soul, feelings and emotions, a breath of fresh air to my music collection."
"I was really fascinated by the books!<BR>But what the film producer made of it is just laughing!!!!!!<BR>Starting on the hairstyles(where are Harry's broken hair?)<BR>to the funny rewrite scenes(Harry comes ggggaaaannnnnzzzz accidentally that Lord Voldemort probably had killed his parents!)<BR>Harry Potter and Fred,George,Ron are, in my opinion, absolute faulty occupations."
Each book in this series got more and more ridiculous. The first book had an interesting premise but each one was on a downhill track till really you couldn't care less what happened to Bella and her mongrel offspring.  I only honoured it with one star because you cannot give it nothing.
"Surprised how much I enjoyed this movie, Capt America is more intense than Iron Man, more confused than the Hulk!"
I recommend this movie to everyone who loves music especially the guitar.Three nice movies a lot of emotion.
"So, as it has been said many times, this film is very weak in many ways. Only the acting captivity of Neve Campbells knows how to betray, Courtney Cox, David Cox-Arquette and Parker Posey (happy, very talented) are committed to keeping the audience in heightened mood. The scenes are remarkable when Sidney (Campbell) passes through the set of Stab 3, the Woodsboro columns. A long-going, boring showdown in an abandoned villa and a completely hane-built resolution round the pleasure from. Popcorn-Kino pur. The three-stars - you can never expect all of the Forts and this part will be removed by the Scream."
It is a really good film!
"A melange of Sinatra, Harry Connick, a charism, a voice!!! for the unconditional jazz, times, super arrangements, a very good interpretation, The indispensable CD has all the afficionados of Jazz..."
Love this album. Arrived in good time as stated.
"This music acts like a balm for the heart, it should be sold in the pharmacy ;-)<br />Hello to all musicians for having dared to work on such a monument, and to facilitate access to a wider audience, while keeping &#34;the essence&#34; of Vivaldi."
"Super to discover the debut of the formation of the Shield and the 1st Avenger. The film is really great even if it takes years back that allows us to understand things about the Shiel on the role played by the father of Iron Man, and then we discover somehow a little more on Iron Man."
"I'm not a big fan of her, I'm not a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her, I'm a great fan of her."
"A cool book for the kids of my age, and i'm happy that another is being written as you read my article."
"The book is well written and it was great to continue the story of Elizabeth, Darcy and the rest of the pride and prejudice characters."
I really like the music of Peter Gabriel. I was purchased this CD again and again. What else should you write about music-smack? Everyone has another one and therefore should decide what happens to him and what is not.
"Buy about 1 month ago. suddenly... impossible to synchronize with the iPhone or iPad.. All the recommendations of the site of Withings Pulse have been followed, without effect: initialization, MAJ of firmware, nothing changes: the synchro launch, the progress bar appears on the tablet (or iPhone) and never starts. &#34;Termine&#34; appears, without nothing being done. More than 20 trials without finish. I wait for the manufacturer's advice and guidelines!!!"
"Que dire, des titres comme Ride the lightning, For whom the bell tolls, Crepping death ou l'incroyable Fade to black sont des morceaux incroyables."
"This book is brilliant, very well written and has both humour and emotion. The characters come to life on the page. You won't be able to put it down. Have the tissues ready!"
"WHAT A FANTASTIC MOVIE, WOW 3D IS AWESOME"
Walt Disney is grateful for his clean children's movies.<br />I'm glad to see the movies again and again
"I have only one regret when buying these books: knowing that Janet Arnold will not publish others. His work is great, detailed, accurate, it’s a pleasure even though to read it. Of all the books I have been able to buy on the costume and historical reconstitution his are really the clearest in terms of the realization of the costumes and the best documented."
"The acting performances are great, as have been repeated several times. But the film is somewhat tasteless at the end. You don't want to watch anymore. Such something cruel (the action at the end) is not for sensitive people. The joke leaves to desire and otherwise is some unlogic. The message of the TRUMAN SHOW is naturally 1a.<BR>But I was not recommended it just for the funny families at night."
"If you put this CD for the first time in your CD player, you will not rest until half an hour later the last stack has passed. <BR>Starting with the \\""rosa moon\"" you walk through the ever darker night full of memories and despair that reveals in the deep red \\""Parasite\"" their darkest background.(\""Take a look you may see me on the ground\"") <br />Doch Drake fought the concept to the end, he falls there at the end where the last stack has passed. <BR>Starting with the \\""rosa moon\"" you walk through the ever darker night full of memories and despair that reveals in the deep red \\""Parasite\"" their darkest background.(\""Take a look you may see me on the ground\"")"
"Derri&egrave;re an infame pocket,factory brand of r&eacute;&eacute;ditions op&eacute;ractic RCA,cover the version of r&eacute;f&eacute;rence of the Bal Masqu&eacute;.Naturally,we have seen more subtle bosses (Muti,Abbado)but Leinsdorf is here dynamic and knows &eacute; listening to his singers who are all bonnement exceptional:Verrett is the best Ulrica of the disk and finds here one of its great jobs,Price is in its best p&eacute;f&eacute;rence and Bergonzi is simply miraculous in one of the most beautiful roles of t&eacute."
"I'm not sure how anybody could compare this book to anybody like Feist, Rowling, Tolkein, etc.<br /><br />The characters are at best one dimensional.  Everyone is instantly either a sworn enemy, best friend or, in one case, both due a highly unlikely incident.<br /><br />The pace is ridiculous for an \\""epic\\"" setting.  Within a few days of meeting the lead character he has :<br />-Killed a legendary beast feared by all by way of his newly discovered magical power<br />-Saved the world's greatest knight from death<br />-Been saved from the stocks by one prince.<br />-Become best friends with another prince<br />-Become the love interest of a princess<br />-Been described as feeling like a son to the king who has met him for all of 5 minutes<br />-Recieved a \\""mystical\\"" bird of prey<br />-Discovered a \\""mystical\\"" snow leopard<br />-other events equally as fantastic.<br /><br />The final plot \\""twist\\"" where he ends up being thrown in prison is poorly engineered and left me thinking \\""Good, i hope he dies there and this story goes no further\\""."
"Although sometimes manipulation is difficult on smartphone, I took a lot of pleasure to discover its fun and sometimes complex enigmas."
Liam Neeson in hard man role. If you liked Taken then you should like this movie although it takes a while for you to figure out what is going on. Thats a good thing not a criticism.
"Just met somebody who was there at the time the story was unfolding, they are also going to read it. Great story in time order."
"Brilliant, very funny and in the moment We are all wondering when, rather than if, we will come face to face with<br />another species, ET's Attention to area 51 is no bad thing either!"
Loved this book. Couldn't pu it down
best diet information first class in everyway thank you
"I was waiting for her new album to be remarked for a few months she's more confident, and it's finally out between a few months, and it's finally out today. obviously I've been in the store and I've immediately bought the deluxe version comprising the 17 titles and the 5 remixes as well as another version of the title \\""born this way\"", and I've heard it a first time having her first titles back to my house. First impression: we've been in this song that's not really a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate of a fate."
"I bought this DVD after having watched the movie in the cinema. it is for me one of the best animated drawings of these last years.<br />It must be said that everything is gathered for: the Santa Claus, the Fee of the Teeth (the little mouse makes an appearance), the Paques Rabbit and the sand merchant.<br /><br />Attention, for all the little ones the mithan croc can scare"
Magnificent repetitions of his old pieces reacted with contemporary singers....What good memories...And always the same voice...super.
I liked the usage of &#34;so it goes&#34; to draw your attention to each death. definitely worth a read of this unconventional book.
It was ok
"What begins very harmless, develops slowly, but very massively into a subway of tension and a shocking story. Whoever really liked to shock, he is exactly right at this film and with weak nerves prefer to watch the strip at daylight! <BR>Who believes any similarities to Joyride can be found here, is on the wrong party, because there is no one at all."
"Taked in the madness of the alternos groups that are reforming (Alice In Chains, The Smashing Pumpkins), we could be afraid of the worst when in the new album of the band to Cornell. So of course, it was not to expect a masterpiece to the \\""Badmotorfinger\"" or \\""Superunknown\"", but the result remains satisfying. Exit the pieces type \\""Live To Rise\"" and other sweets flourishing \\""good\"" the solo career of Chris Cornell (with a part of a \\""Halfway There\"" quite dispensable). Place to the riffs and other Zeppelin plans of Mr. Thayil (\""A Thousand Days Before"" and his oriental atmosphere,\""Non-Actor-Stone\"" that would be more satisfying."
"For the unbeatable price of €12.97 an absolute priceishit (Saturn partly more than €28). Three streams of action-rich cinema from new sights to the most exciting places in Europe with well-doseed and informative bonus material. Everything in it you want to see on the TV screen. Who already needs metal boxes or paper boxes, which all have a different shape and therefore don't carefully fit into the DVD regals. So: Wait for a price below €13 and then beat! Also as a gift recommended."
Previously... review of the uncensored version!! ;)<br /><br />Through the reviews here I have become aware of this film.<br />I am also grateful that it will be dismissed from the purchase as the version must be extremely cut.So I could naturally look for the uncensored version.<br /><br />You must not expect a Hollywood blockbuster scenario to the Last House on The Left Remake.
"As the title suggests The New York Trilogy is three stories combined. The real trick is to figure out how! This is a wonderfully atmospheric read, sprinkled with fasinating anecdotes illustrating the books main themes of obsessiveness and solitude. Paul Auster's knowledge and love of New York is a central vain that runs through all the stories, making it a great book for those wanting to visit or just returned from the Big Apple. I read this a year before going to New York and then again a week after coming back and it added so much to it. A great way to get away from a room full of people. You can disappear, just like a ghost."
"Since I sometimes really like to collect Steelbooks of my favourite movies, I got this here too. The Steelbook is very well processed and definitely looks good in the plate. On the back side of the Steelbook is Spock to be seen, in the same way as Kirk on the front side. Inside the box you see the Enterprise flying from the Navada, but in a black/white design. It was better to do.<br />But it’s a good Steelbook!<br /><br />Over the film I don’t lose many words, since enough people have done it before me."
"This DVD is an absolute MUST HAVE for Sandra Bullock fans. But any other should have watched it at least once. I'm a SB fan can only recommend this movie. It's all included, comic and joke, as well as love and compassion. Look at it and judge yourself!!"
A very good read if a bit gory in several places. Very well written and I read huge chunks at a time.
"This album shows the Drakness in a different light from Permission To Land. Everything that made the first album great is missing here! The lyrics are appallingly bland, the story telling is weak, and the music, well how bad can it get? The only reason I gave this one star was for &quot;Is It Just Me?&quot; which is by far the stand out track! Avoid this album at all costs!"
"The first episode of the Star Wars Saga hardly leaves desires open. image and sound listen to the best what the DVD market has to offer and the bonus material is enough to spend the whole day in front of the TV. So very simply, if you like the movie, this DVD is a must."
"For Gary, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth, on the mouth."
"The chances are that if you are thinking about buying the warriors on Blu-ray you already know about the film so I wont bother reviewing that side of it.  I already owned The Warriors on DVD and wasn't sure if I should bother buying it again on Blu-ray but I am so pleased I did.  Not all films have the money spent on them when they are transferred to Blu-ray and can be worse than the DVD but The Warriors is 1st class.  This film is 30 years old and it is spotless, no grain and sharp glossy clear pictures, it just looks amazing on Blu-ray."
I've had it 3 days and must have played it 5 times (or more) each day.  A big must have for Cliffy fans.
"This album really pays to the best of the metal field and will always remain. The title song Master of Puppets really hurt with the great refrain and the great guitar work that then draws through the entire album until the last track and so can only be called good if an album is produced only at a constant high level. The songs that are on this album immediately go to obedience (Battery, Master of Puppets, Lepper Messiah, Demage Inc. and Orion), so we talk here this time about almost the entire album. The remaining songs are also all played at a great level, but they don't stay straight. If I have to give the single songs to the whole album until the last track and so can only be called good if an album is produced at a constant high level. The songs that are on this album immediately go to obedience (Battery, Master of Puppets, Lepper Messiah, Demage Inc. and Orion), so we talk here about almost the entire album. The remaining songs are also played at a great level, but they don't stay straight."
"the best one yet, this is avery action packed film that is absoltely AMAZING if you liked the first matrix film you will love this even more"
"A fantastic melange of pure action and philosophy has the door of all, we are fun, we are fun, meduse may be, and we can even see it, understand it Platon, the Buddhist philosophy... Reality is it as well as we live it?<br />It would be easy for an action film to try to give itself so many airs of existential philosophy that action becomes it \\""a ship\"".... it would be just as easy for a film of a certain intellectual level that wants to give itself airs of action that philosophy is simplified has a point of non-return that destroys all the effectiveness of it.... and for all this!<br />It would be easy for an action film to try to give itself so many airs of existential philosophy that action becomes it\""a ship\"".... it would be as easy for a film of a certain intellectual level that wants to give itself airs of action that philosophy is simplified with a point of non-return"
"Very good old play, as classic Novize, Brahms is a bit too intense for me!"
"All is in English, and the side buttons are not the same material as the mouse clicks<br />or not a good product."
There is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt that there is no doubt
"As always fast reliable delivery and finally again a real bond and no soft bond as in the last two.<br />Nervic is only that you have to constantly verand the loud, many spoken passages are very quiet and then it will soon get your ears out at action scenes, therefore only 4 stars."
"It was a gift for the wife, she played it for the first time yesterday whilst she was ironing and loves it."
3 good movies especially in 3d I recommend it for what its fans of marvel. special effects extraordinary fast delivery nothing na say a by good movies has all
Entertaining game for the whole family. Would be better if it was aimed at Britain rather than USA. Coins get used up very quickly.
"Donnie Yen's fourth collaboration with director Wilson Yip (Kill Zone, Flashpoint and the very awful Dragon Tiger Gate) is pretty much what we've come to expect of the two, Donnie Yen completely and utterly destroying everyone who attempts to touch him.     With Ip Man it's like the two have finally realized what Yen's strengths and weaknesses are; no mildly complex plot about witnesses or relationships with brothers that require Donnie Yen to show any other emotion other than calm or INTENSE, just a story that starts off as 'My Kung Fu is better than your Kung Fu' allowing Yen and his punching bags to work their magic.    So in short a story built around fight scenes all of which deliver, no cringe worthy moments like those that littered DTG, and a simple story. Yip & Yen finally got it right!"
"If you want your child sing to kill the back of the Oscary song whose original title is &#34;let it go&#34; (Frozen), then sound! Good entertainment taking a fairy tale of Anderson not especially known to the base, and delivered to the Disney sauce. Of three beautiful images, a pleasant story. We will appreciate mostly the music training has the joyful tone..."
"Joe Hisaishi is a great gentleman. He knows how to musically transcribe emotions as no one. Here you will find chosen pieces of Hisaishi for Kitano, far far from the B.O. of pompeous and heavy film. No need to have seen the films to be touched by this CD. The sweetness of a violin for Hana-Bi brings calm or even a little sadness, Sonatine's staccato piano brings a temperate energy by repeating the 8 notes that make it the motive... envoutant. We are forced touched by the beautiful Brother and his sweet melancolia... Fine, sweet, envoutant, the music of this CD invites you to enter the universe of a great composer & more composer."
"We got him because we wanted to watch the second movie! great done, the kids and we also had really fun!"
"This second album dedicated to music \\""Soul\"" does not appreciate forced to first listen.<br />But once we hear it again, we don't get tired of doing it, especially if, like me, we appreciate the style of Marvin Gaye.<br />No regret for this acquisition, hoping that there will be others of the same quality!"
"Really good book, well written and so compelling that I've been reading the whole series so far practically non-stop! Starting to get a bit frustrated that there is no end in sight though, as most of the original main characters have been killed off and the others have storylines that keep twisting. Some kind of conclusion would be nice, and if George Martin wants to write a second series about these people, then I'm sure I would read it, but 5 books is plenty long enough for this one, surely?"
I don’t regret my purchase and my baby is just 5 months old.

"Where can I start? This just awsome. Star Trek is the future for the well adjusted. the &#34;winners&#34; if you may. But what about the rest of us? Decent, hardworking folks - what would the future look like to us. Well probably like it does in Firefly. Morals are grey, drinks are strong and one-liners are plenty."
"A great thanks to The Script for this great album.Etant gives the circumstances in which they realized it (the singer lost his father, the guitarist lost his mother) I say waouhhh, bravo the guys. I love this album that I know recently but that has scotched me, and touches me deeply. lucky for us, the singer Danny O'Donoghue has chosen the song and not the football to spend time...The man who can't be moved and Breakeven are at the top of the list of my preferences, but in the background it's enough to sound a few times the album to become completely attached to others!Alors in summary we can say a proposal of this new album: a new thing, a total symbiose, a total realist, a totalist, a totalist, a totalist, a totalist, a totalist."
A colleague liked this album and he’s super satisfied. then I’m it too.
"I discovered this group by harsard and I became a fan. I had trouble finding this album. I was happy to have it finally in the hands!!! In addition, the white vinyl, ca tape!!!"
"What is there to say that hasn't been said about Tool. They make music that no other band would dare imagine let alone make. What's more, they do it naturally, without pretence. They've inspired almost every &quot;nu-metal&quot; band you can think of and yet stay relatively underground. For my money, this is the best album they've made, although the others are superb. They've managed to take the smooth groove of Undertow and mix it with the harder edge of AEnima. If you loved A Perfect Circle and are sick of Linkin Park then check this album out. For old fans and new boys alike!"
"Top quality<br />The film is a classic, and for a while on the market.<br />The menu drive is simple and the sound grandios.<br />Hat fun made it look at again."
"By a stroke of good luck Mr Oldfield was asked to perform at the 2012 Olympics and this release reflects a burst of energy and it certainly comes across that all had a good time making this. It is beautifully reflective in parts; Dreaming in the Wind is particularly good and the upbeat Moonshine is one of Mike's catchiest songs to date. It certainly isn't Tubular Bells and if you liked Moonlight Shadow and those vocal tracks on Discovery, then this may be up your street. Luke Spiller puts in a great performance too."

"Excellent quality/price ratio!It’s even amazing to find a product so efficient for not too expensive today.Excellent sound, reliability, duration without recharge long and most importantly, easy to use!! to recommend without moderation."
I bought this for my niece for Christmas - she is over the moon with it - fast delivery and good price
"One of the best, most well-written books that I have ever read. Really enjoyed it, worth reading even if you've seen the film, there are quite a lot of differences!"
"My husband and I had promised us more because many good reviews were written. honestly, such a grotten bad film had not been given for a long time. sounded loudly, without good action. No, you really don’t need....<br />Total invaluable..."
"This is the first album of the best period of Supertramp. Tres powerful and well produced. From the first minute, with \\""school\"", we are happe by the musical atmosphere of this album tres homogeneous. The apotheosis with the piece \\""crime of the century\"" which leaves us on a angry desire to listen to the following albums. Unlike some, I don't find that \\""dreamer\"" is the best piece of the album, nor even Supertramp. It quickly becomes tired when you listen to it again. But it's a question of taste well on!"
There is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing as to say that there is no such thing.
This is just a great album. It once more shows that the albums are much more interesting and varied before the commercialization of a artist. The soundtrack is very well produced and produced by the amazing voice of Asaf Avidans and the musicality of the band.
"Love it, bought the vinyl in 1980, got all the singles, bought the CD in the 90's and finally got this on MP3 as quality is superb. Easy download, Phil Collins at his best."
"Neil young shows the strengths of age: untouchedness, calmness. his music pends between the poles and thinks of the shocking pulse of a man who has already seen a lot but has not seen everything. the boundaries to this are clearly fissing. but young broken, to strongly demanded, it is clear that in the broad range of country, blues, bluegrass appear on the new album the number of the balls is desirable- swallowed, discouraged and yet powerful songs that they can do one in any case: they rest because they are melodios, intrusive, but not urgent, because they are hearty, but not kitschig. the boundaries to this are clearly fissing. but young broken, to strongly demanded, it is clear that in the number of the elements of the classroom, they can do it free, they can do it free, they can do it in any case."
"Film that makes the little children vibrate... and the big, I love and I leave a perfect review on the package sending and the delays."
"A very weak and more than agreed scenario, a WTF momentum, ordinary three action scenes...<br /><br />Jason Momoa would be a Conan with potential in a completely different film. The BR has a good image and a bad noise, even if its dynamics is a little crashed with an average level too high (in VF)."
I think it's very fun because it is like the animals are your responsibility and it nice and challenged but not to much and not to easy.
CD arrived quickly and packaged well. It is now played non stop by my frozen mad daughter. Good CD. Thank you.
My son is a  Harry Potter fan and this boxed set did not impress him since it was a very simple text.
"Without the movie Christmas is just half so already.The movie we have seen this year together with our relatives and we have all costly fun. Christmas without \\""clean protection\"" is like Sivester without \\""Dinner for one\"".NO GO!!!!!!"
"I am actually not a miesepeter, but you can really say that the German department of Warner 2011 is a big house and you can no longer take it seriously: Sucker Punch, Lord of the Rings, last Metropolis - the list of erroneous claims does not end!!! at HP 1 - 7.1 there was no mistake so far, but somehow I realized it already. at me (old Samsung player) the picture is okay, but the sound is again and again, although only for small moments (light jumping)."
"I found the series very good at first, but gradually it was really getting worse!!! And of the end I don't want to speak at all... A worse end or equivalent end is given only at Two and a half men Final Season.."
The remake of the very high-named film is really a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit.
Very good book I couldnt put it down. I can't wait for the next book to be released! Very good story.
"I just got the box. First congratulations to Amazon for its shipping speed. Unlike what could be said, the box is made up of a few kinds of 4 pounds containing the DVDs. Their take into hand to get it out of the box that unfortunately is not metal, is quite easy. If you like a few episodes without seeing everything or if you are a fan, don't hesitate to order this collector box."
I truly enjoyed this book since the author was quite successful at adding the personal stories of the Henrietta Lacks family into scientific factual information.
It seems that this album has been realized just a few years ago so it’s always sharp and cingling to his listening. This album is a must for the fans of clapton and blues rock!
"At first glance it turns out that the format is significantly smaller than the \\""Lexicon of the figures, spacecrafts and droids\"". For this also is quite every Star Wars mini-figur, which it has been since 1999 large-formatly depicted, there is still information about the variants of the respective figure. It is - even for the slightly older Star Wars Lego fan - always a pleasure to blade in the book and discover the details of some minifigs. For this, the \\""festive\"" Han Solo - (fast) perfect! But I missed - unlike the above-festive Lexicon - a general information on the background of the making of figures."
"Again, Pixar aims right. In addition to the out-of-pair realization, it is again the fineness and concern of the detail in the scenario, the engraving of the scenes and the rhythm of the film that is worth spending an hour and a half in excellent company. Cerise on the cottage, how to stay long insensitive before such a saraband of dishes before which even the kitchen made by a mouse puts us the water to the mouth as rarely..."
"I love this series, the DVDs are of good quality."
It has been several years I use the products of the brand Plextor and nothing to say the quality is at your disposal. My drawings are correct and read on any platinum salon. I recommend without hesitation.
Brilliant
"A must of the rap with Eminem, Snoop Doggy Dog. A winning return for the Dr. 1h30 of happiness! A musical atmosphere is found with this album.<br />To listen to Emergency, Mr. Doctor!"
"If JK Rowling manages to better this, I'll be amazed. This is a great book and if I ever have children I'll read it to them as soon as they're old enough.  Not that its just for children....  If you haven't read this because \\""its a childs book\\"" well get over it!  Read the first couple of chapters then judge."
"I found the movie funny and the performance of the main actors good. It is not a big cinema, but fun. The last action scene in which Brad and Angelina together k&auml;mpfen, k&ouml;nnte is seen as a positive symbol of marriage :-)"
"A book interesting, very dense and quite technical, but all even quite vulgar. Not always easy to read, but fundamentally quite educational. It’s a pave! Probably a basic reflection for the future"
"I'm a surprise, I've almost wounded myself with a cutter lame by putting my hand in one of the inner pockets; otherwise that's what I was looking for."
"has made everyone (including adults) a lot of fun.<br />Allerdings are smaller than those from Brio 33346000.<br />But don't bother us.<br /><br />Good and really necessary repair: the 1/4 straight line.<br />Therefore, everything fits together again."
"I discovered this CD by the song I only want you, what attracted me on this CD c was first and foremost the cool and discontracts of the thing, and well assure you that continues throughout the album. Well on the prod is not exceptional, the pieces are not very fine but at the end we tape the foot as on the first day (but what is it tells?)"
"This is a best-of album for all those who are already fans and for those who will still be after this album.<br />A worthy voice, accompanied by gale guitar reps...LOVE IT!"
This dvd is great. probably the best show that fans will all love no matter how many times you've seen and heard it.
Joan Crawford is almost perfect because in the film you can perceive either the pr&eacute;sence of a personal exp&eacute;rience of m&egrave;re to the captures with a difficult relationship with one of her daughters (Christine: see her book Mommie Dearest) or the d&eacute;termination of a woman d&eacute;cid&eacute;e &agrave; win in life. The film as such is quite original because it is a v&eacute;ritable melange of black and m&eacute;lo
"Three good moments of humor, Emma Thomson is quite impressive in this role to Mary Poppins<br />A suite exists that deserves to be seen for another good moment"
"The 5 Blue-Rays are safely stored in a 6-Disc Blue-Ray software box(Plastic, first page has no central disc recording, since yes only 5 disc's).<br />This software box is located in a jewelry paperbox.<br /><br />A little negative point: the disc changes are too heavy.The pressure button in the middle is almost not allowed to print and does not give the disc free."
Every few months the same happens - a big shot popcorn is made and then Mamma Mia is put in :) Don't get bored and it just makes fun. Pierce Brosnan's efforts to sing right are fantastic! Most of the actors can even quite well sing and the Abba classic are greatly performed.
"Super cd, super music, super group, what to say more, except that we want to put this foutu cd to the bottom and make the neighborhood enjoy!!!!"
Unfortunately after paying for this item the film continuously froze and we were unable to watch therefore not able to review the film as sections were missing and unfortunately this seems to be a running theme with the new amazon site which is made worse as paying extra for non prime streaming.
"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen!!  He is wonderful live....what an amazing voice, and what a showman.  I could not move from the tele...  and the time went by so fast.  I would recommend this fantabulous dvd to anyone, any age!!!  Sit back and get ready to be taken away by this incredible talent!! Wow, I am still in complete awe......wow, wow, wow!!!!"
Read this after Gone Girl and it doesn't compare! The introduction of the various characters is good but then it just goes on and on. It only becomes thrilling in the last 25 pages or so...
"Marware has created the perfect protection for the Kindle Fire with the name Vibe\"".<br />Haptik is noble and the art leather is well processed.

"So in a box lively buried...the picture is already well Makaber. And then still in the middle of the Nurgendwo!!! That was the reason why the film so pleasantly sounded for me.it was just something else... once from that so some things don’t fit together in this strip, As for example, oxygen break the film already gives the pleasure to put in this box.The acting performance was now not so crazy,but what you want to play out of anxiety already.The dialogues are again and again very funny or profound."
"A very clear film, gives you just a moment to think and look at his life.I can only say you must have seen, even a clean gift."
It has the promised 64 GB and for the price this product is really recommended.
"The series is not bad, but it can’t take it up with most Marvel films – yet I can recommend it to all Marvel fans!"
"All the elements are there to make this a fun \\""sit on the edge of your seat\\"" movie. You have a nuclear sub accident that just gets worse as it goes you have conflict between authority types and free wheelers. There is a love interest (attraction at a distance). Will he make it or is it out of time or out of air or out of distance maybe out of patients. Who knows?<br />Aside from the story there a re great effects and many panoramic scenes. There are lots of bubbles, an abyss and maybe some Ruskies. If you like all those submarine movies this fits in well. Again it is the people action and reaction that make the movie. Don't wait for some slam-bang surprise to appear out of no ware or you will have misses the story.<br />This is one of those movies that have to grow on you and then you will watch it again."
"Good movie for the centenary of the March Cycle by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Excellent visualization of this excellent series of novels called \\""Martins\"" by the author. The action is interesting and you feel really living the adventure. Excellent to discover this cycle if you don't look too much to the modifications brought by the scenario. A single bemol: The scenery doesn't introduce the topic well. If you haven't read the books, you're quickly lost and you don't understand the intrigue or the story leads well. (Fortunately, there's a few bonus explanations on the DVD). The film is the first big base on the book with the series with a few loans to the two."
Item arrived promptly and in great condition. My brother wanted this for his birthday. It's good to know people are finally catching on to this guy now. Thumbs up to seller.
You can get a lot of mood and is very short-lived. you can get a lot of time &uuml;ber l&auml;this makes super besch&auml;ftigen. Therefore there is a very good rating from me
"This anime drawing is a pleasure for the eyes and it's a nice story for everyone, I recommend it to everyone"
"This Cher Lloyd's album is super, all the songs are beautiful, there's no one I don't like. I'm a fan of Cher Lloyd and his album. Well on the titles Want u back, With ur love and Oath are included, as well as super songs for a fairly affordable price. So I advise you to buy it and listen to it. This girl is great :) For those who will buy it, good listen :) I hope you'll like it as much as I have."
It's all with it for a fun but also thoughtful film night...<br />You can recommend it.
"if you haven't read the book then i beg you to watch the film. It is the most compelling film you'll ever watch, a bit doom and gloom at times, but hey that's real life. The acting is amazing, especially from the younger lads, and of course such legands as DeNiro and Hoffman. It's a hard-hitting and intelligent story that is sure to have to gripped all the way though."
"The thing that really sets this album apart from anything else produced in the last 10 years (including Tricky's other albums) is the lyrics.  Like reading Shakespeare or listening to the ramblings of a drunk it takes a while to make sense of the words and realise just how much wisdom there is lying beneath:<BR>\\""You feed me lies, distortion - the English disaster\\""<BR>\\""I was raised in this place, now concrete is my religion\\""<BR>\\""We're hungry, beware of our appetite\\""<BR>I could try writing paragraph after paragraph about the different meanings I take from these lyrics and why I think they show us how ugly and scary an institution modern British culture can be, but I could never get the point across the way Tricky does.  You know when you hear a tune and it's so good that you're convinced you've heard it before?  Well that's how I feel about the words on this album - they sound like they were just waiting for someone to say them.<BR>It's not just the lyrics either - the music creates the paranoid mood the lyrics evoke and the lyrics describe the dark lonely places the music takes you to, making it almost impossible to seperate the two.  The beats are disjointed and messy - but never just for the sake of it.  The chopped up ideas and phrases and the layering of different vocal parts on every song takes you to the twisted place the narrator is living in.<br />8 years down the line and this album still sounds ahead of the game - phrases like trip-hop and chilled-out are deceptive (even insulting), save them for baby food music like morcheeba.  I rank this album up there with all the classics - astral weeks, the stone roses, dylan, marley.  I just hope time proves me right!"
"Thanks Mr John Eastwood<br />Really easy to read a quiet perfect it gives lot of answers, mistake explanations<br />I recommand it !"
"I had bought the book in the bookstore of the Gottinger-Bahnhof and already noticed in the train that this is not a high carater. So what’s boring! From about page 250 it was somewhat more interesting. Why this book should have caused a media spectacle and is still filmed is crazy for me. The film I’m not going to look at. What for critics the mirror actually has, I bought the book namely as &#34;Hochkarater&#34; and &#34;Spiegelbesteller&#34;. That’s why I don’t fall into!!!"
"Still good, as all these Marvel Books,<br />this one is less higher than the others, God knows why?? The box on the other hand has the same size,<br />art is more than ok but I'm starting to miss other than PS-Images."
"Tom Hanks is the man !<BR>Mr Wilson is the ball !<BR>damn good film, worth buying"
"I like all the colours on this game but the scenes are quite small making it difficult to find some of the objects, also the timing aspect is quite harsh. Not too far into it yet so don't know if I will stick with it too long. Pity really as I think it would be quite enjoyable if it didn't make you feel so rushed. I like games to be relaxing."
helps me sub more
"For the first time seen on television and directly enthusiastic. Because of the theme w&uuml;rde I pers&ouml;nlich say that it is not f&uuml;r very small. It is just a typical Japanese &#34;Zeichentrick&#34;film at a high level. It drives to think. First of all, it also brings the spectator a st&uuml;ckchen n&auml;her to Japanese culture.<br />The music is simply beautiful&ouml;n."
The end of the MaddAddam trilogy. Not as great as Oryx & Crake but still good. I liked the second part of the book better than the first.
Too few pieces in this difficult box for children to build something winni is yet well representative
"Great songs, great voice...give it a try"
Good tool for teaching English in CP. It is a starting point for several activities.

"A little decu, but three good moments such as the sequence with Baloo or the one with the monkeys. A Disney classic for the youngest of which I don't make helas part anymore"
"Again a game inspired by Tetris, but with a variant at the gameplay level that allows to renew a little a genre already arch-exploited: slide the pieces to catch the lines.<br /><br />We get to link the parts by repeating: &#34;Go a very little last and I’m going to do something else!&#34;. There may be that the music I don’t find extraordinary, but well, nothing obliges to listen to them.<br /><br />Sympa."
"A few words to follow the questions concerning the area of these blu-ray. In uncertainty, I prefer to acquire this ring in the radius of a large store. These are blu-ray \\""all areas\"". So this is an information error from Amazon. The number of sales expected of such an article, reserves has a customerele warned, does not justify that the publisher makes realising different copies in order to market them in the different regions of the world. Well... I leave you because I am hopeless to see all this!"
The story is beautiful and sad at the same time. you’re attached from the beginning and can very well insert yourself into the characters. It’s the first book I voluntarily read in English. Very impressive.
"There is no doubt, The Mars Volta is one of the last unlabeled band to have fun with the rock codes. Sweet and airy Tantot, aggressive Tantot and angry. Let the fans of the Russian mountains hang up, because this album is special is the box bomb.<br /><br />The second album of these heads, and one of the best first productions of Omar Rodriguez Lopez, of which we have not ended to hear...."

Enya really is great listening to
"More than this I will qualify even this disc of useless or can be useful to illustrate the word fall, in fact, it will be enough just qq years pr that the music of Placebo reaches the ground and crashes on that here by the same occasion, We have it to do not even have musicians but have rock stars and it is the one that resides all the difference, eh yes they have left everything to the point of putting a disc \\""a tubes\"", the 12 year old minetes will be emerveilled but for my part I am decated well that \\""Black market music\"" left this, finally good 'the bitter end\""\""This picture\""\""second\""there are still good radio tubes???"
good against longweile and also already to see will only after a few times play very fast ode because too easy
"Lego buildings are always great. Detailed construction guidelines, all parts available, fun when building and playing afterwards. My youngest daughter stands up and gathers Lego friends with inbrust."

"A great book that helps me to understand the Bolshevik revolution, and the First World War while remaining an excellent story with the characters tres credible."
"The Eighties have decidedly not made a gift!<BR>The poor Ozzy stumbles in the FM songnote. A small guitar solo here, a cloud of synthe through it, a rhythm that has only its name on the paper. Everything is below everything when Black Sabbath puts all your auditive channels sense below it!<BR>Pietre experience, in this well americanisee, which is not a compliment. The master's voice is all rebuilt, it's a pitie. The rock bag deserves only this qualificative. Question: why lose time to re-edite this 22-bits?"
"We bought a new Raspberry Model 2 and like every time I was long looking for the perfect SD card that doesn’t stop the system. This time I put on the SanDisk card and we were not replaced. Normally I use Extreme-Speed SDHC from Transcend, but it seemed to me for some reason this is a bit faster here. It could be that the SanDisk is just better in writing smaller blocks, at least I read this in some Raspberry forums. So to make it short: The card is excellent and can be recommended further.<br />In addition to the service of SanDisk: I bought me 2 years ago an SD card in Australia now."
I have installed the app and couldn’t start it. I always got the message &#34;the prog was stopped&#34; (not enough). On the SGS 5 it has never happened to me. I have deinstalled the app...
"The DVD has absolutely to see and to see again, it’s a real oxygen buffet close to the book so go there with the eyes closed!"
"I have always loved this film, a real weepy and an eye opener. Luckily the attitudes to HIV have changed a bit since this film was made, Tom Hanks and Denzil Washington are brilliant portraying the thoughts in the 1980's when the film was originally made.  Enjoy and think."
An excellent sci-fi film! Charlize Theron is magnificent as Aeon Flux. Interesting storyline and some good art work and special effects.
"See review Season 4 and thank the creators of this fantastic series, you really attached me from the first moment!"
The resume gives jealousy to see it but decued by the film's breakdown sometimes without logic and without end also I expected something else<br />I don't recommend it to the fan of fantastic
"This is a lethal mixture of 2 things that shouldn't ,on paper, go together. The girls J-pop style vocals twined with the fast and furious Heavy Metal does work, and it works well! Once you start listening to it, you can't and won't stop yourself. It is very infectious. This new genre of 'Cute Metal' is as ground breaking as the NWOBHM was. Get it, Listen to it and Enjoy it! Some things don't need to be explained, and Babymetal is definitely one of those things."
"Warner really doesn't care about France, the Batman Begins in plastic box, well ok it's in line with the bluray, The Dark Knight in Steelbook it's already different but remains at the same height in addition there's now the plastic box so similar to the 1st piece, but then the big box of the style Sherlok Holmes or Harry Poetter RDLM 2nd part!!! but what they play Warner part with our nerves."
"If you stand on fast cars that do not exist so in the real world and still like bad music, you are right here.The one of nothing else is the action in this film. <BR>When I watched me \\""The Fast and the Furious\"" I thought after the first quarter of the hour: \\""He actually deserved the Golden Himbere\"".The rest of the film I watched, I just didn't wait to watch it until the end, I missingly sought for a pleasant action. But unfortunately there was no one to find.<BR>Now, two stars I still give it, because the only thing that was overwhelming in the film was his camera drive."
For 20 euros you can expect that you are really every song that appears in the film is also on the CD. Because there are 4 songs missing and the 4 best Sonsg that will all be released in a different edition.
"As usual, the former leader of Dire Straits releases an excellent album, fans will love the others that is what you expect to discover this artist ;)"
Very cool movie!!! super made and quite funny!!!!! is definitely something else!!!!!! is definitely worth watching
Well done that reminds us of the old episodes with the more modern effects to see and review complete video
"This is the first book that I have started to read again after the end. funny, critical and thoughtful. but I liked it especially because of the incredible humor that draws through the whole work. there is nothing to stop!"
"This season 4 decocit. the bonuses are a compilation of American TV pubs promotion. In short, it is expensive paid for a pluto mediocre season. Live the season 5!"
"At the risk of deceiving their fans funky period, the Red Hot delivered us in 1995 a very good Grunge/Hard/Funk album under the baguette of the new guitarist Dave Navarro bringing a new breath to the band. &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; is innovative to the extent or it cuts quite clearly with everything the band had done before. The compositions are more aggressive, the texts more serious, with yet a few moments of pure delusion (&quot;Pea&quot;). To listen in priority to the &quot;Warped&quot;, &quot;Coffee Shop&quot;, &quot;Shadow Be Thy Game&quot;, and the uncontournable &quot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;Aquot;"
"This book has to be seen to be believed. It provides information on all pieces of equipment used by G.I.'s in the ETO, and I have until now found every piece I wanted to identify in this book. Which I think is superb. And I didn't just find it, but all these items are shown in colour photographs with fitting descriptions. <br /> <br />To give you an idea of what to expect I'll give a list of the categories of items on display. The book opens with all sorts of insignia and decorations. These range from unit insignia as worn on the sleeves to rank insignia, and medals and ribbons. Even tailor labels get special mentioning. <br />Next up is clothing. All sorts of coats and jackets, trousers, shoes and headwear is shown. This even goes so far as to treat underwear, so you see that nothing is forgotten. <br />The chapter on individual equipment displays a massive number of bags, pouches, packboards etc. Also shown are canteens and their covers, shovels, wire cutters, knives, flashlights, binoculars, etc. The list goes on. Like I said, I haven't been able to trace anything the author forgot to show. <br />The chapter on weapons is particularly interesting, because it shows the weapons with their ammunition pouches, clips, etc. All are infantry weapons, the heaviest being the M1 8.1mm mortar, bazooka and the M2 .50 cal HMG. But the Thompson is included, so it's not just mainstream weaponry here. <br />Next up is a chapter on tentage, sleeping and bivouac equipment. <br /> <br />The armored troops, airborne troops and mountain troops each get a special chapter, as do female personnel and military police. <br /> <br />There's a chapter on army rations, showing all sorts of cooking equipmen and rations and even a selection of cigarette packages. <br />This is followed by a chapter on engineers, one on the signals corps (showing all sorts of communications equipment, from telephones through radios to handie talkies). A chapter on chemical warfare is next, followed by one dealing with the medical department. This describes equipment and dressing used by field-medics, but also surgical equipment and stuff found in field hospitals. A small chapter on army chaplains is followed by one on army publications, one on personal items and finally one on trophies. <br /> <br />The entire book is printed on glossy paper and the photographs are crystal clear. This makes the book a delight to glance through. The fact that everything is neatly organized allows you to find what you want with ease, and the clear captions that go with the pictures will tell you what you want to know.  <br /> <br />Now from everything I mentioned above you'll probably have guessed that I like this book. In fact I like it a lot and simply have to recommend it to anyone with an interest in the WW2 American Army in the ETO. <br />"
"John Grisham has out done himself once again. I didn't thinkthat I could love a book more then I did The Firm, but this isincredible. The level of action and the way that you become a part of the novel kept me up reading for 48 hours. I found myself laughing out loud at 4 in the morning as the rookie lawyer takes on the big boys, and throws them all a curve ball. Way to go Mr. Grisham, keep them coming."
Learning all sorts of new words playing this game. Took it to the log cabin for xmas and all the family played along too.
"This film once again proves that Anthony Hopkins is a brilliant actor. the film is overthinked, has no logic errors (which always disturbs me in films!) and has a great surprising end."
"Not a crime in the true sense of the word, but rather a collection of different events, a short-term crime, with a real slowness that lets us grow to the heart Mma Ramotswe. You can laugh heartfully on their pragmatism and drive yourself to a different world during the lesson. Very wise and sometimes philosophical. A discovery."
"It’s much more violent than Holyfield vs. Tyson, Burton doesn’t satisfy one ear of Elizabeth Taylor."
Its kind of an old sound but different to anything out at the moment or recently. sounds mature beyond his years. There isn't a track I don't like. Great work Jake Bugg!
"Absolutely loved this trilogy, supposed to be doing uni work and instead i survived on very little sleep and read them all in 10 days. After reading (and loving) 50 shades, crossfire series, this man trilogy etc i was at a loss until I picked these up. The story is fab with lots of clever twists, crying one minute laughing the next. Loved them and I'd re read them over and over."
A clear film that is thoughtfully true without ever becoming kitschy and sometimes laughing at all seriousness. This is a credible Happy End. I liked the film very well and it was interesting to see Felicity Huffman once in a completely different role than usual.
The game is constantly stepping up. it falls down and doesn’t run further.it was a very clean game when it was working.
"Not yet tried in live, but the possibilities and the setting liked very much! and that can also be used offline, very cool!"
My life traveler has been very pleased that you can now hear Gary Barlow in the car.
"I didn’t know this movie, the actor’s game is three &#34; Asian&#34; t exagere at the moment, but the realization jackie chan westernalizes it quite well"
"Goods are fine. everything perfect. product well received as described, quality great, there is nothing to bother,. 5 stars give."
"Celine and Jesse, the dream pair of all romantics, now married for years, more children...but still spiritual dialogue, wordwitz, romantic...toll."
"This album is a totally new direction for Madonna, after her Music Album.  It may take a small while for a true Madonna fan to get used to, but she has got a hell of a lot talent left still and I'll give her great credit for this album.  It's great and shows she's only human like the rest of us!!<BR>Way to go Madonna!!!!!!"
"This is indispensable reading for anyone who has to communicate using presentations and PowerPoint (or Keynote or Impress or whatever).   Nancy Duarte lays out what she has learned from many years of experience producing professional presentations for the likes of ex VP Al Gore.   Her \\""how to\\"" approach works very well indeed.  For example, she doesn't just say \\""make use of contrast\\"" but shows five different patterns for using contrast in practice, illustrated with simple diagrams depicting contrasts in size, shape, shade, colour and proximity.  This book makes advanced slide design accessible to anyone - if you present to other people, you must read this book!"
"And again the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, the thriller, and the thriller."
Dustin Hoffman is just a genius in this film you must have seen. music is beautiful and speaks to the heart. this is a film that was directed for men and women.
"Perfect, simple class, how it all went so. I can't make it! pointful, favorable, good! keep doing so!"
RISE LIKE A PHOENIX! Despite the fact this track features elements of audio distortion it remains an absolute triumph. Instant classic.
"This series just thororoughly brings home the sacrifices the men of easy company had to endure and go thorugh during the war. <br />The episodes at bastogne and \\""why we fight\\"" are particualry harrowing but at the same time you never want to turn off.<BR>You feel like you are a part of Easy Company whilst watching and as if you know the characters well. <br />A must buy, even if you're not into other war films this box set will impress and at times, upset you."
"I can join all the positive reviews....warm as well from this filming....and see already after the first view in this film an absolute favorite film; also the duration of the film I find great....But I have to join the opinion of the lady who has interfered with the synchronization.I find Mr. Rochester's voice doesn't fit at all; she had to be more markant. Also the \\""smalling\"" and \\""smalling\"" in the 2nd part (where it's smalling ;-)) has stopped me a little - you had left it away (I mean this excursion) it was more romantic."
"The film is a little less Tom Cruise's own, because it's a little more logical than some Mission Impossible film. - Good tension, not so untransparent that the film has become boring and great action.<br />Perfect to just hoke a few minutes before the TV and the head a little gap in combination with good entertainment."
"For his return before the audience, Barbra had chosen to give a free concert. Among the 123 people oh how privileges, about twenty personal invitations, but above all a hundred admirers who had the chance to be shot to the fate. This concert is a little return to the sources for Barbra who has started his career in the cabaret. Three great quality of singing, mastery of space and the audience. From the three great Streisand."
"When we gather so many scammers, scammers and thieves in one film, he can only laugh.<BR>Without forgetting the great performance of Brad PITT, who happily for us has not the role of the narrator(he eats more than three-quarters of his words).<BR>I look forward to him to decide to get out a number 2"
Excellent recived item pretty quick.
I love this album - starlight and supermassive black hole are such brilliant songs. Muse are by far one of the best bands around at the moment. They always deliver amazing albums that dont disappoint.
"The title reminds the film well... A sad little girl leaves her old habitat to demention before losing herself in another world, strange, and full of denunctions like the cupidity of human being. The film approach is of the best effect. If you are reticent to watch a manga of this quality because it is a << anime drawing >>, and well break yourself, and watch this film that for you will open the doors of another facet of the cinema: the animated film!"
"We may never know the answer to this question.  But this movie is unquestionably a classic.<br /><br />Like it or not (it is impossible to not like it), this is a standard by which other movies are judged.  The script, actors (some of whom are Rod Taylor and Suzanne Pleshette), and execution are always being compared to earlier and later movies.<br /><br />The story adapted from Daphne du Maurier, does seem to be a little mysterious as to why the birds suddenly appear and as to the ending if that is what it is; however the build up and execution of the conflict with birds, and between women is defiantly worth watching.<br /><br />A small town is devastated when a bunch of birds terrorize the inhabitants in what seems to be an all out war. The graphics leave a little to be desired but you will be so absorbed that you do not care.<br /><br />If you have the DVD watch the movie before the goodies (extras.)<br /><br />Feel the tension build up and be sure to duck at the appropriate time.  After all this is an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Also, see if you spot his cameo appearance."
The good
"I have already played other of this kind, but this is variable.<br />W&uuml;rde recommend it to anyone who has time to play it every day."
"F&uuml;r me as an anf&auml;nger is not so ideal for dancing, rather for H&ouml;ren."
A beautiful - modern mark.<br />I will - after a short break - look again.<br />I love it - and by the way - my child too.
"I have almost all the CDs of MJ and I find this successful. He makes us a panache of all his voice stamps and his multiple and unique capabilities!, the themes are different, the music is great. We hear from far his son Prince Michael still small. For me he would have to make a tobacco. this CD was badly gone since he had to get out in 2000, but he has been picked up since!! GENIAL! ALWAYS EGAL THANK YOU MIKE!!!!"
"My wakker has a super design, clean colors and is a HINGUCKER. It shines in the dark and is easy to use."
"Better than Creed they should be, it was what I knew before I bought the debut of Alter Bridge \\""One Day remains\"" and this steep thesis then they were also right. A scattered rock guitar, as you rarely find its equivalent these days, and an emotional very original voice make sure that this disc becomes the absolute rock pleasure. <BR>This music is the absolute madness, when hears you hang in the rock sky."
"Love this book. Spend many Sundays browsing through it. Great text and images really portraying the atmosphere of a special person, place and time."
"In my opinion, the film is really good, the atmosphere is cloudy and dust, the story is so legendary (I love legends!!) and the actors (particularly Johnny Depp!) are great!! <BR>To the super horrible film came a little more comic from Johnny Depp, which I fell above all!!"
I have loved reading the trilogy. Thought this slightly lacked the pace of the other two but still a great read.
"Every time you can look at it is always great and only right when you’re in a depth, this film builds one again a little."
Love this app.  Great visuals and brilliant alarm.  Gives you options to choose how to wake up.  Great get up call
"I normally don't read Science Fiction. I normally don't read nonfiction. I normally read nothing but fantasy novels and books I'm required to for class. When I got 50 pages into this one, though, I knew I wouln't be able  to put it down, and I knew I would love it. It didn't fail to live up to  either of my expectations. I believe that anyone who enjoys intelligent  reading will love this book, hands down."
"I’m going to comment on the bluray support and specifications, the movie all fans can say: the best Marvel after Avengers (But Guardians of the Galaxy is ahead!)<br /><br />Menu: pluto beautiful, spoil not too much the music movie you have (DTS HD MA for the menu) From the menu Made in Disney.<br /><br />Son: English 7.1 DTS HD MA 5Mbits/s in average, we don’t comment on this kind of mastering, it’s nickel!<br />French: 5.1 DTS HD day 2Mbits/s fixed, big dynamic but a hair less powerful than the VO, finally it feels following the equipment you have.<br /><br />Imbr />Gall of the demo part of Made in Disney.<br />French:French:French:French:F"
"Cannot get a consistent charge. Tried moving seating position several times and it drops in and out. Nice design, but rather expensive as just a desk stand!"
"I was surprised by how affecting and well produced this film is. An emotional and funny film, it's definitely worth viewing."
"A magnificent universe has the boundary of the feery, a very interesting story and always a little point of humor.<br />I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon and its delivery delays more than correct :)."
A great game I’ve played on my tablet. I really wanted it to get more of these games.<br />Everyone who likes to play adventures should go here.
Excellent as the first Star Trek 11 action loaded and as always with a good set of stars. I look forward to the next.
"How did this film get so many good reviews? Just when the newest Bond looked so believable! We all know that there are scenes that verge on the impossible in all the bond films but in Skyfall I found myself muttering \\""that's a bit silly\\"" way too often. I'm afraid that is the final word on this poor effort.......silly!"
Very pleased with purchase. As described. Many thanks
"Was working ok but as others have said, pictures were not showing and was being continually asked to update. Downloaded update, and now will not even open on kindle fire. Massively inconvenient and annoying. My page is suffering from fewer updates as a result. Wish I'd left it as it was, with at least some functionality. Get this fixed please!!"
"So there I was at 9 O' Clock on Monday morning, waiting to buy an album on the day it was released for the first time in 24 years.  The last time I did this was to buy In Through The Out Door (Zep's last album in 1979).  I had read a couple of reviews which said this was gonna be good - but how good?<br />Of course there is \\""The Song Remains The Same - good in parts but by their own admission Zep were not on top of their game for those gigs and the album seems curiously lifeless.  <br />And then there are all those naughty bootlegs - variable sound quality, variable performances....<br />So what of HTWWW?  I listened to a few snatches and then had the pleasure of a nice LONG business trip by car to really listen to the album.<br />This is a full 3 CD, 3 hour compilation and it effectively a full Zep gig from 1972.  <br />And the verdict is?  AWESOME!  This has to be the best live album ever released - the phenomenal power comes through (boy does it come through!), mixed with quieter moments and some amazing ad libs - many tracks are extended medleys which sound superb.<br />The track list is pretty much everything you could want - ok so we don't have any material from Physical Graffiti, because that wasn't out 'til 1975, but otherwise its more than enough.<br />So, if you like Led Zeppelin this is all your Christmases come at once.  If you like rock music in general, buy this album and wonder why no-one else gets within a mile.  If you don't like rock music but wonder how a band gets to be the second biggest selling in history (after The Beatles) without releasing any singles or appearing on TV - buy this album and then you will understand.<br />The Mighty Arms Of Atlas.................."
The network cable must be ordered (it is not there). The charging cable works perfectly with the Kindle Paperwhite. I am satisfied with this purchase.
"One advance: I liked to be able to turn off at a film in a short time, to be entertained and have fun to enter into other worlds. I don't look for any mistake in the logic and don't put any reality claims. Otherwise I prefer to see myself just a documentation.<br /><br />Whiteout was and is for me a wonderful popcorn cinema with action, tension and a solid performance by Kate Beckinsale in a magnificent environment of snow and ice. Whoever has seen the Underworld films knows that it doesn't just fit in these films. Some more sensitive tastes should be better to see that one or another time.<br />Whiteout was and is for me a wonderful popcorn cinema with action, tension and a solid performance by Kate Beckinsale in a magnificent environment of snow and ice."
The only good are the effects. otherwise I don't understand the excitement. the action is banal. unrealistic technical outcomes. not so great.
Three great CDs.<br />All known songs of Queen.<br />For Queen fans a absolute must.<br /> Also suitable for gifts.<br />I would immediately buy again.
"This is a review of the FiiO E17 \\""ALPEN\\"" portable DAC (digital to analogue converter) and headphone amplifier. The E17 (codenamed ALPEN by FiiO) is at the time of writing the flagship model of the company, which, in a sign of the times, is a specialised Chinese firm that focuses on engineering high-end amplifiers and DACs for headphones.<br /><br />The package includes the following:<br />1. The FiiO E17 ALPEN<br />2. a USB-mini USB cable<br />3. a 3.5mm connector (both ends feature a 3.5mm jack, which seems to be gold plated, although I'm not positive about this)<br />4. a 3.5mm to RCA adaptor<br />5. an optical connector<br />6. two silicone bands, which can be used to hold together the ALPEN and another portable device such as a smartphone<br />7. six rubber feet (!)<br />8. a velvet pouch<br />9. a brief instruction manual (8 small pages in English)<br />10. two screen protectors (!)<br /><br />As the completeness of the set would suggest, FiiO have really put a lot of thought into not just their device, but also into how it might be used by their target end user. I found this attention to detail quite impressive. The full set is designed to enable easy and immediate use with a range of applications, and in very a portable fashion, should you so wish it.<br /><br />As to the unit itself, the build quality, from external inspection, is very good. The case is a black-hued brushed metal finish that is well-machined and beautiful to behold. There are no rough edges and cheap plastic bits that were so characteristic of the inexpensive Chinese electronic product of yesteryear. The screen is a 2 colour OLED, and very clear. Buttons are are metal, in a very nice finish. The whole thing just exudes quality, of the sort one usually expects from devices of European or American manufacture.<br /><br />I have used the E17 only for about 2 weeks, and in only one set up so far:<br />-music files: ALAC (ripped/converted from CDs or SACDs by iTunes).<br />-player: iTunes on a macbook pro 7,1, or iPhone 4S<br />-headphones: several, all very high quality IEMs.<br />The music I listen to is almost exclusively classical, and the source material of very high quality.<br /><br />In the above set up I find the E17 does what it says it does: amplification is robust (to the point where I find I cannot turn up the volume to the maximum 60 for many tracks without risking damage to my ears). There is no distortion in the sound when used with Etymotic reference IEMs or JHA custom-made IEMs; when used with the Bowers and Wilkins C5, I notice at high volumes there is a certain amount of \\""strain\\"": I believe this to be a reflection of the limitations of the earphone rather than the E17. Bass response is smooth: this is the first time I've heard \\""enjoyable\\"" bass from the Etymotic's reference ER.4 series, famous for its highly accurate, neutral sound, a direct corollary of which is what may seem to be a more subdued bass. The treble response is likewise quite nice, although with my set up there is very little difference, as would be expected.<br /><br />I would like to record here a problem I faced early on when using the E17, as it may be helpful to other users. DACs and headphone amplifiers will mostly be used with digital sound sources stored in portable machines. A problem with sound reproduction from this sort of set up is that numerous components are in very close proximity to each other, and interference with the sound signal can potentially ensue. I believe I've experienced an example of this. When I plugged in the USB cable from the E17 to one of the two available USB docks on my macpro, I was greeted by horrible \\""interference\\"" whenever the mouse moved (this problem has been documented in several reviews on the net). When I switched the USB cable to the second dock, all was pristine and beautiful. Both USB docks work properly, of course; the first however probably sits next to some internal component related to the trackpad, and when connected to an external DAC and amp such as the E17, produces audio interference whenever the trackpad is activated.<br /><br />Another reviewer has pointed out that the screen does not sleep; to switch off the display you'd have to toggle the Hold button. This is true, but of little consequence unless it shortens the lifespan of the display; I have not had the unit for long enough to be able to tell. Other reviewers on Amazon UK have pointed out that pairing the E17 with an Android smartphone can be a bit of a challenge, apparently requiring a separate USB cable or firmware/kernel modification. I have no experience with this.<br /><br />In summary, I think the ALPEN does what it says on the tin, and is a product of surprisingly high quality, supplied in a thoughtful package.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: From a general inspection of the reviews on Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, and headphone specialist sites, it seems to me that the major quality concern with the FiiO ALPEN is centred on the various output and input jacks, mainly the AUX input jack at the bottom of the unit and the headphone output jack at the top. Most complaints seem to suggest that these parts are not built to the level of quality of the rest of the unit, and seem to come off or otherwise stop working. I have not owned my unit long enough to be able to reliably comment, but on visual inspection I can see that the metal ring on my AUX inlet jack is not precisely centred, suggesting it has not been manufactured or machined at the level of some of the better consumer electronic products available today."
"Watched this film recently, never got round to it following it's release. Scared to bits. Still(after 4 nights) having trouble sleeping.  Seriously - don't watch this film alone. I cannot believe some people don't find this film scary, however I was watching it under the impression that it was based on actual events. At the time of it's release I heard several times that it was a re-enactment of real events. So watching the demon take hold of Katie and drag her down the hallway and all the other awful stuff it does had me wide eyed, transfixed and holding on to my husband's arm as though the demon was peering through the lens, looking at me and thinking you're next.  We have since discovered that it is a work of fiction but that hasn't lessened the horror that I feel when I wake up for my 3am wee-wee, knowing I've got to go down a staircase to the nearest bathroom.   This film is now in a bundle of 2 DVD's we own labelled NEVER WATCH AGAIN!  Sami'Jane - Chris's wife  Oh, for those of you wondering the other one is The Amytiville Horror"
GOOD REPLACEMENT CD
My 4-year-old daughter likes to play with her little legos... They are great because there are for girls and others for boys.
I really enjoyed this book. It was both funny and sad.  Very touching.  Really glad I downloaded this.  Can't wait to read some more books by this author!
"After the successes of Adler's film adaptations of &#34;Sin City&#34; and &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; it was clear that one day the Graphic Novel was filmed by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley and was not threatened by the Persian Lord.<br />Greece is not threatened by the Persian Lord.<br />King Leonidas of Sparta is ready to struggle with the cost of the film, but the old traditions and the laws of Leon, which have been corrupted by his rings&#34;The Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings."
"Better quality than the DVD, when it comes to a dark film, the Blu Ray quality is indispensable and well present."
"320 pages of experience, know-how, generous decryptions of the technical horizons of the circular tricot. Everything is through a colorful and attractive pageing desire!<br />This is this kind of formidable book that turns you to learn technical English...because a work approaching in Galician does not exist...of all!<br />There is, however, it seems, more and more Francais who tricot! And the circular needles (small, discret and practical) have so attracted me from that I was interested in the tricot, that I understand badly that such processing-resources on the techniques associates these tools are not diffuse, in the French, in the French, in the French, in the French, in the French, in the French, in the French."
I got this for my 6 year old son so as expected I had to build it but that said he has looked after it and it's still not in pieces but then it's logo.  The little characters are not great but the children do not care about that. Worth the money I paid.
"X-men do it again, quality film"
"If you like a sexy romance, paranormal and shape shifting, this is the book for you. If you want to spend a couple of hours enjoying a well written short story, this is the book for you. Highly recommend it!"
"This film has it all - humour, sadness, empathy, pathos, love.................all the ingredients that make Mike Leigh films head and shoulders above all others.  The main characters Tom and Gerri are superb and the film follows their lives and that of their friends and family over the course of four seasons.  I really recommend this film to anyone who likes a good Brit Flick and anyone who is a Mike Leigh fan."
"The most influential story of all time, depicted with shockingly vivid imagery that takes us all too painfully close, to our shame. <br /> <br />The Passion of Christ, regardless of your level of belief, communicates undeniable truths: <br /> <br />     humankind's capacity for hate  <br />and  our ability to justify  <br />     the unjustifiable. <br /> <br />`will we ever learn?' <br />"
The film is excellent. We find it with pleasure on the DVD or the quality of the image and sound are at the date. The only reproach would be at the level of the collector box. The film provided with the box is the same for all the box. It is a small detail that has its importance to differentiate its box from another.
"Excellent series, one of my preferences! it's full of humor! I love!<br />this will rejoice a wide audience!"
A surfaced disc that hardly resist has several ecoutes. agreed melodies carried by a stunning sound. Some pieces emerge all of itself but we are very far from Radiohead to which they are often compared.
pleased with this product I recommend I buy them for my 8-year-old daughter fan of lego friend a happiness for her
"Well on it's a nice product, the photos are wonderful, the packaging successful, the demo versions of the songs are interesting and even more than that if we talk about the demo of She's Out Of My Life simply superstitious...the first cd when he has it is nevertheless nothing more than an emieme compilation....surely well made and to recommend for all those who't have yet to buy the best of Michael, but it's not the cd that we'd have to expect. the unedited song is just a bad mixed demo, whose voice recording is overcompressed and disagreable to listen..the arrangement is fast done and the choice is out of this ""new"" which is no more than a discourse of the best of Michael, but it's not the cd that we'd have to expect."
"Where The Immaculate Collection left off Celebration continues, ok so the album is missing a few Madonna hits but it's only a 2 CD compilation and to produce an ultimate greatest hits it would have taken 3 discs. Madonna's career has been long and varied and this album covers most musical genres and goes a long way to prove she isn't just an 80's artist of even a 90's artist. Madonna moves with the times, sometimes she creates new sounds and also trends. The definitive female artist and queen of pop owns and earns her place as an Icon and and the reason why so many female artist exist today. Celebration includes no.1 hits over 3 decades and an extensive top ten selections. My one issue is the track placement but then it's a digital age so you place them in any order you prefer. This CD is a must for anyone and the DVD to accompany is jaw dropping."
"After my Granddaughter watched the 2 discs , I had to order the Books of the Hunger games Trilogy.<br />All arrived in tiptop condition and on time.<br /><br />Thank you"

"I have full expectation in September the Limited Edition pre-ordered. on 21.11.2006 then the Postboat came. naturally as usual by Amazon properly packed. the content of the Limited Edition you all know, I have nothing to write about it. the image band for this is the hammer. really successful moment recordings of the concert sites, the fans and our boys R+. <br />Now I look two days later once after the offer of Volkerball and must find that the Limited Edition is already overwhelmed and only is offered by private at high prices. But that was to be expected. From a fan community you can't speak with such providers naturally. you know what I mean. I still hope many fans can buy this edition for a full price."
"an amazing album from an amazing band, many out there would have expected more of an ok computer or bends album as opposed to a kid a or amnesiac, but thom and the boys do music in their own way and its a marvellous result!  put this on your cd player, turn the lights down low, move cutting instruments away and just chill out to this superb album! best album of 2003!"
"This box is perfect, It’s pretty, the pockets of the albums remain quite class and the CDs Sobres."
"We had already the Petterson inventions Deluxe (which is very good) and therefore also bought PE2. Unfortunately in the PE2 app are absolutely identical level as in PEDeluxe.

God thank you we ordered the app as a free app of the day and didn’t spend any money, otherwise w&uuml;rde I’m even more verar...t f&uuml;hlen."
Brillant from start to finish love it!!!
The end story was exciting just like the previous two.  A lot of questions about Thomas's character and his involvement in the Trial process unanswered.  The opening chapter gripping!
"The story is repeated, humans come to steal ETs on their own planet, as the Americans steal their lands to the Indians.This says this film is a pure wonder and, for my part, I find that the decorations steal the star to the actors. if Pandora could exist, I would voluntarily take my neighborhoods! to see, re-see and re-see!"

"The master of the entertainment, the man who can simply perform everything musically in the highest brilliance, demonstrated in the London Royal Albert Hall, under the tossing applause of the crowds in their evening clothes and fine clothes, his horses.

This CD should ever listen. I recommend the DVD to the concert, since then you can experience the whole feeling of the concert."
"This album collects songs that are not all the memes and at the same time, if we love one, we easily love them all.<br /><br />To know if you’re going to love or not, listen to the extract, for this album, it gives very quickly a general idea.<br /><br />The only reproach that I have to do to this album is that the song Skinny Love has three legers noise of saturation (for some notes on the piano that are not so sharp compared to the voice of the artist) that appear from 2min40s...I don’t know if it’s all my equipment that’s soft (*) or if it’s a failure of recording for example by the volume of the sound, but I find the piano, but I find the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD, the CD,"

Bah yes between 2001 and 2011 there was only 3 albums so little singles compared to the best of 2001 or there was before 5 albums so more singles. Mylene changes over the years and fortunately because otherwise we would get tired of always hearing the same thing."

"The book was really recommended to me by a Scrum Developer course and this is right: It’s not &#34;Woolfuhlbook&#34; as the author writes, but you’ll be invited to think about it. Thus you experience the practical guidelines and then apply them unconsciously in everyday life."
"Approaching V for Vendetta with no clue as to what it was about, but slightly off put by \\""from the makers of the Matrix\\"", i am so glad i undertook this shot in the dark. Its a truly mesmerising film, starting with the spectacular use of what MUST be every word beginning with V in the dictionary and culminating in a fantastic \\""stand up and salute\\"" moment. Following the machinations of the enigmatic V (masked for the whole film, his true identity never wholly revealed) but through the eyes of Natalie Portman's Evie, we are shown a government-dictated London run by John Hurt, where just about everyone with power is corrupt. This is nothing new, and its your typical big brother style future.<br /><br />However, ring out the unimagination and exposing what lies at the core of the film - the satirising stabs at our own governments and their conspiracies. Some of the detectives have theories but can't act for fear of being 'silenced' by finger-men. One man, driven to rage and Vengeance by a lifetime of pain and damnation, predujice and exile, starts to reVolt.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving gives it his all in a wonderfully charistmatic performance despite incased in a creepy Guy Fawkes mask. Natalie Portman is Natalie Portman, and yes, as you've no doubt heard, has all her hair shaved off at one point. Stephen Rea's police detective is wonderful, being the good guy through and through but caught in a government run department where his hands are tied. Stephen Fry's absolutely excellent cameo is a must see. John Hurt, although his inclusion seems only a shoehorned cameo, is your standard dictator, playing much the same role as Sean Pertwee in Equilibrium.<br /><br />What seems to set this film aside from the other future noirs is thats it not some utopia of the future (see Equilibrium, or Aeon Flux) or some dank infested futurescape (see Blade Runner), its London, simple as that. It doesn't look any different to how it is now. (which makes the opening and the finale that little bit more shocking.)<br /><br />Jarred minimally by a slower midsection than its terminals, any low point is redeemed when you get to the \\""punch the air\\"" moment near the end.

"The Invicta has made me a very &uuml;friend through the processing. It has surprised me that this clock is so g&uuml;bad. The Seikourwork with a second stop is bew&auml;hrt and good.<br />Other than the often installed Miyota 9001 clock works it silently disrupts its services.<br />All in all you can't do a lot wrong here. If there are too strong gang deviations, so l&auml;the problem will be fixed by a small regulation of your clock maker. The Seiko clock works can regulate or repair any good clock maker, as there should be no replacement for me in the world under the seikour problem.<br />The good processing and the good processing of this clock is not clear in this price and the good processing of this clock maker."

"Superb adaptation of the excellent BD screenwriter by Alan Moore. I expected to have a great easy production, I who didn't really like the Matrix (\""V for Vendetta\"" was sold in France as the new film of the team of \\""Matrix\""). In fact I found that very successful, and impressive visually. The antagonism between the characters and the effective despotic system in which they evolve are very well described. Nathalie Portman is very convincing (and so beautiful...), the other actors are attachant as well... Nothing to say, I loved the film even if it makes some entorses to the BD's origin. <br /> the realistic reflection he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the film, he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the socialism, he has the responsibility of the socialism of the socialism."
"This 1971 album is far and away the best Rod Stewart album and one of the Top 10 albums of that decade.  This was only his third album and it went to the top of the album charts both in the U.S. and the U.K., whereas &quot;Gasoline Alley,&quot; released the previous year had only made it to #27 on the Billboard chart (it would not be until 1979 that Stewart would have another album reach #1, with &quot;Blondes Have More Fun&quot;).  In the early part of his career Stewart managed to find interesting ways of mixing folk, rock, blues and country, both in his single career and as the front man for the Faces, who released both their second (&quot;Long Player&quot;) and third albums (&quot;A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse Faces&quot;) that year as well (&quot;Stay With Me&quot; was the big hit off of the later).  So for Rod Stewart 1971 was a very good year.<br />The big single off of this album, of course, is &quot;Maggie May,&quot; hit #1 for several weeks (this was the first song we played for our daughter Maggie, the day after she was born).  This is one of the great songs about being seduced by an older woman.  Two other singles charted, the rockin' cover of &quot;(I Know) I'm Losing You&quot; originally done by the Temptations, which made it to #24, and Stewart's poignant cover of Tim Hardin's &quot;Reason to Believe,&quot; which ends the album on a quiet note and made it to #62.  Then there is the exquisite &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot; (played by some guy Rod forgot the name of) and the frenetic energy of the title track, which lulls you into a false sense of security by beginning with an acoustic guitar part before the drums start drivin' this one hard and fast.  Surprisingly, most of the songs on this one are covers, the exceptions between &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot; and the title track, the latter co-written by Stewart with lead guitarist Ron Wood.<br />Stewart exhibits a lot of range on this album and for me the only that could possible qualify as a misfire would be the cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Tomorrow Is Such a Long Time,&quot; which is a bit ironic because you would think that would work.  &quot;Seems Like a Long Time&quot; is pretty good, as is the rollickin' &quot;That's All Right&quot; by &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup.  I even love the sheet music on the &quot;back cover&quot; (&quot;It's Full of Good Things and Loads of Suggestions&quot;). As far as I am concerned if your choice is between this and a Rod Stewart &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD, get this one because it is all downhill for Stewart from this point on.misfire would be the cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Tomorrow Is Such a Long Time,&quot; which is a bit ironic because you would think that would work.  &quot;Seems Like a Long Time&quot; is pretty good, as is the rollickin' &quot;That's All Right&quot; by &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup.

I bought it to offer it to my father and he loves it! the mechanism is pretty to observe and the size of the cartridge is perfect for his wrist (because I was afraid it would be too small for a man!).<br /><br />Three very good quality-price ratio!
I'm a big fan of the movies and possess every album because it's just something else here than these instrumental things you're otherwise used to Soundtracka.

It is a remake but it is really well done. The anxiety is omnipresent as we knew to do it yesterday. A terrible film that interpels our consciousness and puts us in front of the consequences of our actions. A advice, make the right choice: See this film."
"Although also Schindler's list represents the persecution of the Jews moving is \\""The Pianist\"" the film that leaves a deeper impression. The director of Roman Polanski comes just closer to the topic. In every relationship a masterpiece."
Good app
Enjoyed . Good plot and wanted to read on ---. Recommend.
"Since in the past months there are a lot of new albums that are in the beginning of the song, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums, it’s just a lot of new albums."

Easy to use and thorough.
"The three films gathered in this magnificent box, with in prizes a DVD filled with bonus."
"Whether Andy McNab wrote this all off his own back or if it was heavily edited by someone else, this was, for a me, a suprisingly good book. I was recommended this book by someone who's all \\""Guns & Ammo\\"" and I expected it to be very much along the lines of \\""I saw six blokes and I slotted five of 'em\\""; It really wasn't like that at all. The central character, Nick Stone, isn't the typical bullet-proof James Bond sort, but a real-life bloke with all the failings you'd expect (but don't necessarily encounter), and as such, he takes a fair few smacks as a result.    This is a very well told story that will make you want to read further into Nick Stone's life in future books.     Considering I'm a non-Guns and Ammo type, I was very impressed."
"A wonderful film about childhood and affection.<br />Burry of humor, tenderness, nostalgia & emotion!<br />4 fantastic young actors.<br />Music is great!<br /><br />A little jewel I discovered at school, and I continue to love!"
"The idea of always having a lightning on the USB adapter is good, but the processing is bad.<br />after about 3 weeks the oasis is cut off and therefore it is not allowed to be placed on the closing bond.<br />with a taper that is precisely designed by dafur, this should be made of rubber rather than plastic."
"I have the switch to be able to switch between a FRITZ!Box and a computer<br />(data backup via USB remote connection or \\""NAS\"" function of the FRITZBox lasts eternally).<br /> function top, processing i.O., only to the PIEPSEN when switching I could give up."
"Sound and image: at the top, especially for those who would like to test their bass box<br />The scenario takes place as follows: gentle robots and ugly clocks are putting pins. The effort of concentration will not be situated at this level! This is said, the scene is at the service of the battles, there is a story of which we feel the sympathetic efforts to humanize and fool the scenario.<br />A pop corn film claims or escapes to American patriotism (or the realiser is Spanish)."
The most beautiful love story you shall ever set your eyes upon.
"A great film, a great end and emotional wonderfully played. of course, this film also plays because of the imaginary strengths and effective performance beyond all physical boundaries, unlike some other incredible films, it doesn’t take me here."
My favorite by this wonderful band- a must have!!!

"This album is amazing! I'd read things on the net about this album before it's release, I'd decided I'd buy it as I enjoy 'world music' ,ie something not sung in English!   <br />A song is a song?  <br />There's more to music than listening to the lyrics for me!  <br />This is simply superb, from the heartbreaking vocals of Avec le Temps to the playful, spaced and sexy Contact and so much more in between and after thanks to the english bonus cd. Jezebel finally gives Ms Carlisles voice an almost 50's Hollywood panache (and then some) that it so richly deserves. A top track of mine if you hadn't guessed!!! The dance version of La Vie En Rose, Bonnie et Clyde in french and english....  <br />There are songs to fall in love to, fall out of love with and well be in love to, it is French after all!!  <br />The best thing Belinda Carlisle has done in many years. <br />I can't say more than buy it!! <br /> <br /> <br />"
"Spielberg's unnecessary movie with a good cocktail of suspense, action, terror, but also humor :) I'm not going to get stuck on the movie that everyone knows by praising its merits, but rather slide a little word on the 3D version that has us simply bluff! Some reviews are more detailed than mine and uses the right jargon for what is technical details also I'll be pleased to tell you that the feeling of being really immersed in the heart of action is terrible, the image clear and wonderfully works, the 3D well thinks... In addition, it has 13.99 euros, it's really worth buying it for who's the movie fan and dinosaurs in general ;)"
"In principle - I find the CD good! soul confusion to Jimi, Prince, Kravitz and even ne idea M. Gaye are horbar.<br />But I am so surprised that you can find 4 pieces of the 1st CD (EP) here.<br />First I folded me deceived, but I admit the pieces are in slightly new clothes."
